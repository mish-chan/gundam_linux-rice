Riced Linux configurations for a Gundam-themed desktop. For all the Gundam fans out there!
Big shoutout to Diinki, their video and repositories taught me how to do my first Linux rice!

<h3>Disclaimer about the GTX Theme</h3>
I only created a GTX-Theme 3, this means that the theme does not translate onto Nautilus. If you used Nemo, I'm sorry the theme is kind of ugly there! However, it looks very nice on Firefox.
